### Introduction

This site provides links to resources generated as part of a BBSRC-funded strategic Longer and Larger (sLoLa) project on the dynamics and evolution of swine influenza in pigs.

### Repositories
- [GenieR](http://github.com/swine-flu-slola/GenieR): an R package for the estimation of demographic trajectories from phylogenies
- [popseq](http://github.com/swine-flu-slola/popseq): an R package for the analysis and visualisation of viral deep sequencing datasets

### In progress
- Links to viral deep sequencing datasets
- Simulations of within-host viral evolution

### Authors and Contributors
